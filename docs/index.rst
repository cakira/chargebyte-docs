Welcome to Charge Control C User Guide!
=======================================================

**Charge Control C** is an IEC 61851 and ISO 15118 (CCS) compliant charging
controller, born to beat in every kind of electric AC vehicle charging station. The installed
software is based on EVerest, an open source software stack for EV charging infrastructure.
It is capable of the ISO 15118 control and proximity pilot signals as well as the PWM charging
signal, conform to IEC 61851. It can directly control actuators like locking motors, contactors
and ventilation.
With its amount of general-purpose IO, it can be connected to a variety of periphery. It comes with
the standard interfaces to be connected to electric meters, RFID devices and different kinds of
actuators and sensors. Charge Control C is currently available in three different hardware variants
(Charge Control C 100, 200 and 300) that are suitable for different complexities of charging
stations.
